# KDebugger
a Linux debugger (and eventually a profiler) built with C++

This was something I have wanted to do for a while and all the better
with my love for C++. This project will and currently uses C++17 however
I'm looking too (after completion) to incorperate newer C++20 and 23 features
like coroutines etc... that may help utilize a more modern, asynchronous
architecture.

This project features a debugger tool that I personally use on my Linux
Fedora build for development. Following this I'll make my own dissasembler
and other tools and eventually - fork them into a stuite of tools
